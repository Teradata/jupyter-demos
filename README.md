#ClearScape Analyticsâ„¢ Demonstrations via Jupyter
 
Welcome to ClearScape Analytics Experience.  This service consists of [multiple demonstrations](#Table-of-Contents) of the industry leading in-database analytics that **you can run on your own**.
You can modify them or use them as examples to use with your own tools against our data or small (not sensitive) data you upload. Each notebook will:
- describe the business situation,
- will attach the needed data from the cloud, and
- walk you step-by-step through the use of the ClearScape Analytics functionality.
 
These are <u>functional</u> demonstrations executed on a tiny platform with small data, but the same functionality is available on all of our platforms up to one with hundreds of nodes and petabytes of data. 
ClearScape Analytics allows you to apply AI, ML and advanced statistics to your data without the cost and complexity of exporting data. 
You can develop sophisticated models on other platforms with your favorite tools and import those models to execute in production at massive scale.
 
If you've never used Jupyter before, we strongly recommend reviewing the **First Time User** section of **Getting Started**. 
You'll find an [**introduction video**](./Getting_Started/Introduction_Video/Introduction_Video_SQL.ipynb) with tips on using this platform. 
There are also tips for you if you just want to <b>[look without programming](#I-am-not-a-programmer)</b>. 
If you have questions or issues, [**click here**](mailto:SC230208@teradata.com?subject=ClearScape%20Analytics%20Jupyter%20Question) to send an e-mail to ClearScape Analytics Support.<br><br>
