    "* RAM: 22 GB\n",
    "* <b>Updated: Total Disk Storage: 120 GB</b>\n",
    "* Recommended Maximum DBMS table space: 28 GB.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though it is running on GCP, data can be exchanged with all cloud platforms. We've provided demos in the catalog that integrate with data stored on AWS. This experience is focused on ClearScape Analytics and is agnostic to the surrounding cloud service.\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard \"Free\" usage is 40 hours over a 30 day period, based on 4 hours a day for half of the working days.  There is a Monitor application that will check your environment every 5 minutes and if there has been no usage for 2 hours, it will suspend your environment. You can return to the ClearScape Experience web console to resume your environment. That usually takes between 10 and 15 seconds. You can also suspend your environment manually from the  Console. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will receive a warning message if your environment has not been used in the past 14 days that in 14 more days, the environment will be deleted. However, you will still have an account and you can provision a new environment which has the advantage of getting the latest notebooks. If you use a notebook or run queries in Vantage, your environment will not be deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each environment has a maximum life of 60 days.  You will receive a warning message at the end of 48 days about the pending end-of-life for your environment.  At 60 days it will be \"Terminated\" which will prevent you from starting it but allows you to request a short extension to recover any work.  Seven days after environments are terminated, they are deleted. \n",
