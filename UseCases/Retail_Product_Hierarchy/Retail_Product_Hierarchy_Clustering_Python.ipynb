    "\n",
    "<p style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial;color:#00233C'>The retail industry faces challenges with their product hierarchies. Current hierarchies typically group products in a way that makes sense for procurement but often do not reflect how customers shop.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial;color:#00233C'>To align product hierarchies with customer shopping behavior, products should be grouped based on similar sales and demand patterns, indicating a strong correlation in their sales time series. However, the existing hierarchies are based on business rules rather than time series analysis. For example, all types of bread are placed in the same subgroup. While this approach works well for some product families—perhaps up to 80%—the remaining 20% are less straightforward and require further investigation. This can be achieved by applying AI/ML models to uncover the diverse dynamics within a subgroup  </p> \n",

    "<p style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial;color:#00233C'>Aligning product hierarchies with customer shopping behavior using AI/ML models can offer several business benefits:</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<li style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial'><b>Improved Inventory Management:</b> Understanding the true demand patterns of products allows for better inventory forecasting and management. This can reduce stockouts and overstock situations, leading to cost savings and more efficient operations.</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "<li style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial'><b>Optimized Product Placement:</b> In physical stores, aligning product hierarchies with customer behavior can improve product placement strategies. Products that are frequently bought together can be placed near each other, enhancing the shopping experience and potentially increasing sales.</li> \n",
    "\n",
    "<li style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial'><b>Relevant Recommendations:</b> Improved product hierarchies can lead to better product recommendations. When customers see suggestions that are relevant to their interests and needs, they feel understood and valued.</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "<li style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial'><b>Efficient Shopping:</b> A well-organized store layout, whether online or in physical stores, saves customers time. When they can quickly find related products, it makes their shopping trip more efficient and pleasant.</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "<li style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial'><b>Enhanced Loyalty:</b> Satisfied customers are more likely to return. By consistently meeting their needs and expectations, retailers can build stronger customer loyalty.</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial'>Business value is achieved through grouping products with similar sales/demand behaviors and deriving the correlation between the time series of the sales unit by product. \n",

    "\n",
    "<p style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial;color:#00233C'>To build more effective ML and AI models, developers and data scientists must explore unconventional data sources, tools, and techniques to continuously improve their models’ accuracy, speed, and efficacy. However, this creativity often comes at a cost. Additionally, integrating diverse analytics and data into the development pipeline typically increases complexity, fragility, and operational challenges</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial;color:#00233C'>Luckily, Teradata Vantage provides ClearScape Analytics functions which allow users to seamlessly combine a wide range of behavioral, text processing, statistical analysis, and advanced analytic functions with model training and deployment tools on the same platform.</p> \n",
    "\n",
    "<p style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial;color:#00233C'>This allows for rapid development, testing, and validation of new techniques at scale in near-real time so new, more accurate models can easily be deployed to production.</p>\n",

    "<p style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial;color:#00233C'>The demonstration  aims to show how to enhance product hierarchies in the retail industry by leveraging time series analysis and clustering techniques. The objective is to identify clusters of products exhibiting similar sales/demand behaviors across the product hierarchy, often defined according to product descriptions or business rules. The first part focuses on data exploration and visualization to understand product relationships and assess clustering strategies. The second part involves clustering by correlation, using a coclustering algorithm and in-database correlation matrix computations to group products with similar sales patterns. The third part covers specific feature engineering, utilizing functions like TD_NORMALIZE_OVERLAP and applying K-means clustering to refine product groupings based on engineered features.\n",
