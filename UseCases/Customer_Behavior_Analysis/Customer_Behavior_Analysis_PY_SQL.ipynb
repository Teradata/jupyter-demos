    "nPath is useful when your goal is to identify the paths that lead to an outcome. The nPath function scans a set of rows, looking for patterns that you specify. For each set of input rows that matches the pattern, nPath produces a single output row. The function provides a flexible pattern-matching capability that lets you specify complex patterns in the input data and define the values that are output for each matched input set. For example, you can use nPath to analyze:\n",
