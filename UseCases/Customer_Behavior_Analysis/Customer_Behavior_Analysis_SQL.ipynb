    "<p style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial;color:#00233C'>Customer behavior varies from industry to industry and company to company, meaning there isn’t one easy solution. Although it seems complex, Teradata Vantage and ClearScape Analytics can bring some clarity to the customers’ behavior. Keep in mind that customer activity can include website click data, healthcare records, or financial data. Users will need to combine all this data to get a full picture of the customers’ experience. Using pathing analytics, businesses can understand the common paths that customers take that lead to a variety of outcomes, such as sales conversion, cart abandonment, or product searches. When businesses use Vantage to analyze all their data at scale, they have the chance to increase customer satisfaction and conversion rates.</p>\n",

    "<p style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial;color:#00233C'>Vantage has unique analytic capabilities for understanding customer and user behavior over time. In fact, these analytic techniques can be applied at massive scale to derive more accurate results. Then, these results can be combined with other analytics to create more advanced and accurate prediction models. Vantage also allows organizations to scale these models horizontally, by training segmented models per region, user type, etc., or vertically, by combining data from millions or billions of interactions. All of this can be deployed operationally to understand and predict actions in real-time.</p> \n",

    "nPath® is useful when your goal is to identify the paths that lead to an outcome. The nPath function scans a set of rows, looking for patterns that you specify. For each set of input rows that matches the pattern, nPath produces a single output row. The function provides a flexible pattern-matching capability that lets you specify complex patterns in the input data and define the values that are output for each matched input set. </p>    \n"
