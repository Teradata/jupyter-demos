So, people go into a branch and are opening another type of account and they are referred to opening a wealth management account as well!</p>"

These analytic techniques can be applied at massive scale to derive more accurate results. Vantage allows us to scale models horizontally, by training segmented models per region, user type, etc., or vertically, by combining data from millions or billions of interactions. All of this can be deployed operationally to understand and predict actions in real-time.</p>"
