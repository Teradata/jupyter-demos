These analytic techniques can be applied at massive scale to derive more accurate results. Vantage allows organizations to scale models horizontally, by training segmented models per region, user type, etc., or vertically, by combining data from millions or billions of interactions. All of this can be deployed operationally to understand and predict actions in real-time.</p>"
