    "<p style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial'>A <code>retriever</code>  is an interface that allows you to retrieve documents based on an unstructured query. It is more general than a vector store, as it does not need to store documents, only retrieve them. Vector stores can be used as the backbone of a retriever, but there are other types of retrievers as well.One of the most common types of search used in vector stores is similarity search, which compares the similarity between the query and the stored documents to retrieve the most relevant results. This is the type of search used in our vector store retriever.</p>"
