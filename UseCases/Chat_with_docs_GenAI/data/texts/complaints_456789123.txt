I had a home equity loan with Discover Bank for {$75000.00}. In both the Loan Estimate and Closing Disclosure, it states under " Prepayment Penalty '' that there was none. I was also told this verbally. However, in a later set of documents it does describe a prepayment penalty if paid off within 36 months. I believe this discrepancy between the documents is deceptive. I believe I was lead to believe that there would not be a prepayment penalty and was surprised to find this {$420.00} penalty in my payoff letter. I spoke with a representative who agreed that it was misleading then a supervisor who noted that it was in another document which I signed. I told him I felt deceived but he was not willing to refund the prepayment penalty. I'm curious as to how many other people they are doing this to.
