I went to apply for XXXX home equity loan on XX/XX/XXXX. I got full pre-approval under the terms of 30 year loan interest of 9.99 %. I accepted this. They then requested lots of different information that I submitted. Every file said accepted. On XX/XX/XXXX I called them up because there was a small problem with the mortage statement I submitted. At this time I was told I was no longer approved because of debt to income ratio. The thing being I already had pre-approval and even the proof of income was already accepted. This loan would have been XXXX of my current debt payments without the loan.
