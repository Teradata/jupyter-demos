The client requires us to forecast the number of passengers who fly using their airline. The ARIMA model has been widely utilized in many fields for forecasting since it is recognized as reliable, efficient, and capable of predicting short-term share market movements. Hence, we'll build an ARIMA model to forecast the demand(passenger traffic) for Airplanes.\n",

It has three hyperparameters - P(autoregressive lags), d(order of differentiation), and Q(moving avg.), which respectively come from the AR, I and MA components. The AR part is the correlation between previous and current periods. The MA part is used to smooth out the noise. The I part binds together the AR and MA parts.</p>\n",
