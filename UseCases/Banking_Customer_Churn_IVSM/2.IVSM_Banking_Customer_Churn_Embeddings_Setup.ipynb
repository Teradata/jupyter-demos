Additionally, the lack of assistance from customer service to rectify this issue is disappointing. I've been a loyal customer for years and it's unfortunate that I had to face such a poor service experience, which is below the high standards I've come to expect from your institution. \\n\\nYours sincerely,\\n[Your Name]\n",

While I understand fees are inevitable, timely notification was not received on my end. Your bank has always been upfront and transparent, which is why this incident comes as a surprising disappointment.

Unexplained charges have appeared on my account and my repeated attempts to rectify this with customer service have led to unfruitful discussions and delayed responses. I feel my concerns are not given any importance despite being a loyal customer for many years. This kind of service is unacceptable and not what I have come to expect from the bank.  0.001084 -0.032043 -0.007676  0.012568  0.007153 -0.079309  0.060439  0.023770  0.068384 -0.043171  0.008448  0.009891 -0.038787  0.016697  0.028150  0.016967  0.012562 -0.123140 -0.019336  0.049869  0.018242 -0.029344 -0.015755  0.002785  0.013494  0.014741 -0.006771 -0.009995 -0.089284 -0.108638 -0.000850 -0.040921  0.006696 -0.058689  0.097195 -0.000020 -0.049577 -0.025291  0.036766  0.028692 -0.004776 -0.001872 -0.048143 -0.039414 -0.010679 -0.018274  0.026876  0.015699  0.058191 -0.016275  0.017611 -0.047667  0.014780  0.042776 -0.020367  0.048276  0.015286  0.009573  0.020898  0.010541  0.043946 -0.030171 -0.099491  0.023798 -0.011773  0.053348  0.028847 -0.027937  0.022558 -0.031941 -0.009273 -0.063772 -0.037015  0.113635  0.030772 -0.010885  0.050963  0.004545 -0.023499  0.073339 -0.011044 -0.017702  0.007663 -0.067192 -0.005066 -0.055710 -0.019339  0.028607  0.034242  0.005161  0.071687  0.043177  0.044128 -0.002900 -0.077381 -0.008493 -0.026630  0.021977 -0.089477  0.463795  0.034088  0.070028  0.055042  0.000323  0.013015 -0.033911 -0.039001  0.003404 -0.002231 -0.053502 -0.035744 -0.025592  0.089167 -0.021109 -0.020278  0.054436 -0.033123 -0.016861 -0.022538  0.029394 -0.020274  0.032516 -0.006350 -0.021891 -0.062420 -0.077373 -0.021433  0.082597 -0.051849  0.054176  0.023557 -0.057216 -0.056280 -0.020243 -0.011312 -0.015747 -0.027892  0.077571  0.090105  0.020935  0.013516 -0.069350 -0.054163 -0.007021 -0.037022  0.010501  0.026978  0.042291  0.022212 -0.002101 -0.031329  0.009894 -0.013511 -0.064157 -0.021737  0.010403  0.016598 -0.005756 -0.035831  0.019566  0.076675 -0.042552 -0.054094  0.055311 -0.006526 -0.063149  0.009478 -0.031675  0.023273  0.051214 -0.008963  0.013240 -0.017894  0.007408  0.074175 -0.019267 -0.015137 -0.009337 -0.016827  0.013966 -0.004160  0.002356 -0.026240  0.019363  0.020366  0.000513 -0.020059  0.011948  0.005286 -0.042777 -0.077356 -0.065038 -0.072609  0.048346 -0.005765 -0.010883 -0.001531 -0.038965  0.012869  0.003472  0.023539 -0.013190  0.031017  0.000550  0.034895  0.089441  0.000368 -0.038460  0.070602  0.007516 -0.015084 -0.003514  0.054486  0.017562  0.014615 -0.021506  0.064103  0.056009  0.011057 -0.039021 -0.005176  0.002020 -0.002473 -0.326838  0.002922 -0.035781 -0.068197 -0.020866 -0.030280  0.013814 -0.024836 -0.041243  0.063881  0.006315  0.027163  0.053617 -0.078647  0.026972  0.006887 -0.006702  0.079492  0.005403 -0.007142 -0.077840  0.000481  0.014097 -0.021146  0.030744 -0.016804  0.138755 -0.035967 -0.046563  0.004622 -0.024608 -0.029864  0.034120 -0.052343  0.029852  0.004488  0.019457  0.046330  0.008943 -0.026618 -0.047914 -0.013572 -0.024555  0.012094 -0.030532  0.058825 -0.017766  0.064359 -0.030462  0.019057  0.032070 -0.038320 -0.000898  0.042430  0.070910 -0.052990 -0.031839  0.095109 -0.023667  0.041891  0.042374  0.005876  0.048032 -0.033674 -0.014826  0.027709 -0.019438  0.019722 -0.011890  0.013859 -0.048747  0.081657 -0.032043 -0.069307  0.040494  0.030648  0.007991  0.003024 -0.031402 -0.027094  0.011240 -0.032799  0.062261  0.018565 -0.021569  0.055910 -0.029275  0.037947  0.007107 -0.053793 -0.061656 -0.010930 -0.051464 -0.048480  0.067298  0.013073 -0.180765 -0.029279 -0.011180  0.044041 -0.005032  0.093483 -0.018634 -0.023918 -0.065817  0.015696  0.035386 -0.014508  0.016672 -0.057044  0.038891  0.025421  0.007097 -0.039178 -0.001828  0.040687 -0.006054  0.064037  0.140295  0.047757 -0.038576 -0.038334  0.001160  0.040026  0.029135 -0.004227 -0.050150  0.001962  0.009732  0.027643 -0.002992 -0.090398  0.023850 -0.000949 -0.028356 -0.030871 -0.030673  0.038146  0.031879 -0.002011  0.064799  0.034047 -0.001645 -0.037491  0.013811  0.017401 -0.004467 -0.043211  0.041182  0.079822  0.095587  0.043115 -0.074899 -0.020759 -0.008078 -0.011266  0.029379  0.018823  0.010686 -0.060486 -0.048254\n",

Recently, however, I noticed an error in my monthly statement. It appears there has been a discrepancy in transactions that I have not initiated. I trust your systems and was surprised by this development. Could you kindly look into this matter and remediate these unauthorized transactions? Looking forward to your prompt resolution. \\n\\nThank you,\\n[Your Name] -0.029667 -0.045148 -0.004769 -0.030212 -0.018060 -0.075672  0.045629 -0.003652 -0.000350 -0.021615  0.033123  0.010973 -0.025078 -0.001581 -0.008144  0.012254  0.029949 -0.079941  0.006743  0.049710  0.014754 -0.040123 -0.014968  0.011416  0.035815  0.055184 -0.002587 -0.033451 -0.095419 -0.133636 -0.026226 -0.020131 -0.001790 -0.044237  0.060905 -0.009388 -0.062205  0.012650 -0.018525 -0.000015 -0.037230  0.007876  0.007912 -0.049609  0.007570 -0.032658  0.043841  0.046697  0.034271  0.043295 -0.005189  0.014087  0.019446  0.085589  0.021861  0.096557  0.027750  0.070966  0.000070  0.025174  0.033716  0.035018 -0.118111  0.013543 -0.040076  0.047433  0.032728 -0.058377 -0.039563  0.016096  0.017782 -0.051639 -0.045698  0.022571  0.037043 -0.016752  0.033259 -0.007955 -0.011953  0.051226 -0.011213 -0.025249 -0.017730 -0.037344 -0.045303 -0.029671 -0.008975  0.037795  0.025452  0.006412  0.066733 -0.004354  0.081765  0.003179 -0.057491 -0.017467  0.007106  0.001442 -0.036183  0.470796  0.062827  0.024272 -0.004289 -0.003702  0.015209  0.018372 -0.026969  0.042595  0.019015 -0.009163 -0.035592 -0.002668  0.063855 -0.064042 -0.032517  0.065635 -0.003753 -0.054492  0.019817  0.034358 -0.027525  0.055569  0.001292 -0.014657 -0.080304 -0.090138 -0.022376  0.084610 -0.019403  0.042008  0.026256  0.004241 -0.053570 -0.039690 -0.000387 -0.020982 -0.021956  0.010444  0.090743 -0.030189 -0.002650 -0.040062 -0.054333  0.000293 -0.013338  0.088745  0.028499  0.022240  0.025482 -0.013655 -0.029024 -0.003825 -0.010575 -0.091081  0.013901  0.032370  0.057237 -0.010237 -0.003779 -0.024939  0.034350 -0.048141 -0.059105  0.069475  0.015843 -0.054818 -0.022076 -0.011518  0.003491  0.021258 -0.001435  0.000836 -0.030223  0.029147  0.053907 -0.052674 -0.005640 -0.046578 -0.012781 -0.004931 -0.002101  0.054045  0.022068 -0.016893  0.011032 -0.059741 -0.037565  0.006129  0.043013 -0.050231 -0.037979 -0.030978 -0.069548  0.032594 -0.039012 -0.039999 -0.013341 -0.022630 -0.016735 -0.048864  0.118883 -0.011358  0.042771  0.042591  0.013585  0.065112 -0.001820 -0.067214  0.013102  0.014645  0.011419 -0.017453  0.037923  0.018318 -0.016308 -0.020676 -0.022506  0.064241  0.015070 -0.021655  0.010593  0.070638  0.002237 -0.314916  0.002324 -0.013208 -0.026781 -0.015017 -0.031226  0.043799  0.014677 -0.019304  0.034698 -0.043379  0.005358  0.026523 -0.073284 -0.004758  0.045431 -0.055113 -0.042377 -0.032905 -0.057026 -0.080597 -0.022913 -0.024444 -0.027861  0.013176  0.020709  0.110302 -0.012988 -0.055703  0.003037  0.001496  0.001886  0.020029 -0.063975  0.067765  0.012425 -0.030467  0.071874 -0.021209 -0.048278 -0.014458 -0.003778 -0.022587  0.047161 -0.004816  0.018062 -0.053991  0.005300  0.014351  0.015856 -0.005038  0.019086  0.021949  0.099713  0.092923  0.007865 -0.050340  0.099014  0.013253  0.051338  0.046411  0.003630  0.027675 -0.004604  0.055159  0.036937 -0.008452 -0.041592  0.027244  0.067160 -0.028188  0.047179 -0.031614 -0.033893  0.032676  0.013569 -0.012863  0.003678 -0.031564 -0.089193  0.038955 -0.063818  0.102023 -0.002046  0.001882  0.095828 -0.011942  0.024102  0.011818  0.005156 -0.030886 -0.003976 -0.095610 -0.006923  0.033312 -0.008807 -0.199438 -0.002204 -0.029145  0.019464  0.006782  0.044479 -0.001493 -0.003792 -0.061700  0.024955 -0.006957 -0.018710  0.013002 -0.015102  0.051073 -0.025698  0.026913 -0.045559  0.002362  0.033128  0.060951  0.026667  0.142434  0.049548 -0.070105 -0.036433  0.040598  0.012959  0.069124  0.003172 -0.034784  0.005268  0.021435  0.022556 -0.039785 -0.031599 -0.040529  0.044157  0.034047 -0.055569 -0.069583 -0.008887  0.005285  0.022289  0.041223  0.042996  0.004592 -0.018551  0.061211  0.010490 -0.025512 -0.043449 -0.012962  0.031788  0.032201 -0.012514 -0.071035 -0.010149  0.000555  0.012126  0.013556  0.005960  0.052721 -0.019531 -0.068285\n",
