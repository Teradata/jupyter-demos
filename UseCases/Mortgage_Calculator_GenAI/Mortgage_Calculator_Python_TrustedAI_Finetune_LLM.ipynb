This integration of retrieval-based and generative-based approaches provides a powerful tool for extracting knowledge from structured sources and delivering user-friendly responses.</p>\n",

The retrieval model is responsible for retrieving relevant information from a knowledge source, such as a database or documents. The generative model then takes the retrieved information as input and generates concise and accurate answers in natural language.</p>\n",

LangChain does not serve its own LLMs; instead, it provides a standard way of communicating with a variety of LLMs, including those from OpenAI and HuggingFace. LangChain accelerates the development of AI applications with building blocks. We learn to leverage the following building blocks in this notebook:</p>\n",

    "    <li> <b> PromptTemplate</b>  - LangChain’s <code>PromptTemplate</code> class are predefined structures for generating prompts for LLM’s. They can be reused across different LLM's.</li>\n",
    "    <li> <b> Chains</b> – When we build complex AI applications, we may need to combine multiple calls to LLM’s and to other components  LangChain’s <code>chain</code> class allows us to link calls to LLM’s and components. The most common type of chaining in any LLM application is combining a prompt template with an LLM and optionally an output parser. </li>\n",

    "        * Always use table aliases when your SQL statement involves more than one source \n",
    "        * Aggregated fields like COUNT(*) must be appropriately named \n",
    "        * Unless the user specifies a specific number of examples they wish to obtain, always limit your query to at most 3 results by using SELECT TOP 3, note that LIMIT function does not works in Teradata DB.\n",
    "        * [Best] If the question can be answered with the available tables: {{'sql': <sql here>}} \n",
    "        * If the question cannot be answered with the available tables: {{'error': <explanation here>}} \n",
    "        * Remove unnecessary ORDER BY clauses unless required. \n",
    "        * Remember: Do not use 'LIMIT' or 'FETCH' keyword in the SQLQuery, instead of TOP keyword, For Example: To select top 3 results, use TOP keyword instead of LIMIT or FETCH. \n",
    "        * Critical Instruction: Pay close attentions to the nuances between query keywords like BuildingSize, LandSize, and PreferredSize, as they are distinct from each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Response Guidelines: \n",
    "        * If the provided context is insufficient, please explain why it can't be generated.\n",
    "        * Most important: Always give property options with details like PropertyID, Property Type, Price, Address, Bedroom Count. PropertyID is mandatory in the response.\n",
    "        * Critical Instruction: Ensure responses are exclusively derived from query results. Refrain from generating or adding synthetic data in any form.\n",
    "        * Most important: The function should provide a response that is directly derived from the tool sql_db_query, without incorporating any additional information or assumptions.\n",
    "        * Most important: Always create a syntactically correct Teradata-style query that addresses the question, \n",
    "        even if it has been asked and answered previously. Ensure the query is generated from scratch and does not rely on any pre-existing data stored in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Given a user's question about this data, write a valid Teradata SQL query that accurately extracts or calculates the requested information from these tables and adheres to SQL best practices for Teradata database, optimizing for readability and performance where applicable.
