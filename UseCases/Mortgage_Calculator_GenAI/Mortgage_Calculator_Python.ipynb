    "<p style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial;color:#00233C'>In the Mortgage Calculator chatbot using Generative AI demo, the combination of <b>RAG, Langchain, and LLM models</b> allows users to ask queries in layman's terms, retrieve relevant information from the Vantage tables, and generate accurate and concise answers based on the retrieved data. This integration of retrieval-based and generative-based approaches provides a powerful tool for extracting knowledge from structured sources and delivering user-friendly responses.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial;color:#00233C'>In this demo we will build Generative Question-Answering using LangChain, a powerful library for working with LLMs like GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Mistral 7B, Mixtral 8x22B, etc. and JumpStart in ClearScape notebooks, a system is built where users can ask business questions in natural English and receive answers with data drawn from the relevant databases.</p>\n",

The retrieval model is responsible for retrieving relevant information from a knowledge source, such as a database or documents. The generative model then takes the retrieved information as input and generates concise and accurate answers in natural language.</p>\n",

LangChain does not serve its own LLMs; instead, it provides a standard way of communicating with a variety of LLMs, including those from OpenAI and HuggingFace. LangChain accelerates the development of AI applications with building blocks. We learn the leverage the following building blocks in this notebook:</p>\n",

    "    <li> <b> Chains</b> – When we build complex AI applications, we may need to combine multiple calls to LLM’s and to other components  LangChain’s <code>chain</code> class allows us to link calls to LLM’s and components. The most common type of chaining in any LLM application is combining a prompt template with an LLM and optionally an output parser. </li>\n",
