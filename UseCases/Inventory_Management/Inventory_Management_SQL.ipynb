    "<p style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial;color:#00233C'>Phantom inventory refers to inventory that appears in inventory systems as available but is not actually present in the physical stock. This discrepancy creates an illusion of higher stock levels than what’s really available, leading to problems such as:<ul style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial;color:#00233C'><li>Stockouts: The system believes products are in stock, so new orders aren’t placed in time, leading to stockouts.</li><li>\n",
    "Lost Sales and Customer Dissatisfaction: Customers may place orders expecting products that aren’t physically available, resulting in delays and frustration.</li><li>\n",
    "Inefficient Replenishment: False stock levels cause issues in planning, leading to unnecessary orders or missed replenishments.</li></ul>\n",
    "<p style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial;color:#00233C'>Phantom inventory issues often arise due to system errors, poor tracking, inaccurate manual counts, damage, shrinkage (theft, loss), or unprocessed returns. To catch this in the system we can create a phantom_inventory_flag which is set whenever the stock difference is significantly high. For our example we have taken a five times the average daily sales for that product.<br>For this the we have calculated below values and set the flag accordingly.<ul style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial;color:#00233C'><li>\n",

    "This is the actual count of items in stock at the end of each day. If there’s no data, it assumes zero.</li><li><b>Phantom Inventory Calculation:</b>\n",
    "Phantom inventory is calculated as the difference between expected stock at the end of the day and the actual end-of-day stock. Expected stock is based on yesterday’s leftover items plus any new items that arrived today, minus today’s sales. If these numbers don’t match up, it suggests a \"phantom\" difference that could indicate missing or unaccounted items.</li><li><b>Flagging Large Discrepancies:</b>\n",
    "A flag is set if the phantom inventory (difference) is significant, specifically if it’s more than five times the average daily sales. This helps catch larger, unusual discrepancies, prompting further investigation.\n",

    "<p style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial;color:#00233C'>Out-of-stock situations i.e when the item is not available for purchase, happen when there isn't enough stock to meet customer demand. To avoid this, retailers set a safety stock level, which acts as a warning point. When stock falls below this level, it signals that it’s time to reorder more. The remaining stock should then be enough to cover customer demand until the new stock arrives.<br>There are different ways to figure out the right safety stock level for a product, which is the amount of extra stock to keep on hand to avoid running out. In our demo we will look at two methods that fit the specific situation of each store and product:<ul style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial;color:#00233C'><li><b>\n",
    "    Previous Stock Before Reorders:</b> This approach uses the amount of stock that was on hand before previous reorder times.</li><li><b>Average Daily Sales and Delivery Time:</b> This method calculates safety stock based on how much the product usually sells each day and how long it takes for new stock to arrive after ordering.</li></ul>\n",
    "<p style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial;color:#00233C'>\n",
    "For each store and item, we will choose the smaller of these two values as the safety stock level. For this  we first we will need an estimate of the inventory on hand, which we worked on in the earlier phantom inventory calculations.</p>"

    "<p style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial;color:#00233C'>Not all products generate sales daily at each store location. However, when a product remains unsold for an extended period, it may indicate a potential issue with its inventory status, warranting verification.The challenge lies in defining what constitutes an \"extended period\" since sales patterns differ widely across products. For example:<br><b>High-demand products</b>: For items that consistently sell hundreds of units each day, a sudden zero-sales day could signal an inventory issue.<br><b>\n",
    "    Low-demand products:</b> Conversely, for products that typically sell only a few units per month, multiple days or even weeks without sales may not be cause for concern.<br>\n",
    "To identify potential inventory issues effectively, we assess the frequency of zero-sales days for each store-SKU combination relative to the total days the product has been available for sale. This approach allows us to estimate the likelihood of a zero-sales day for each product, facilitating a data-driven perspective on which products may require inventory review. "
