    "Hugging Face is a French-American company based in New York City that develops computation tools for building applications using machine learning. They are known for their <b>Transformers Library</b> which provides open-source implementations of transformer models for text, image, video, audio tasks including time-series. These models include well-known architectures like BERT and GPT. The library is compatible with PyTorch, TensorFlow, and JAX deep learning libraries. <br>\n",
    "    Deep Learning Models in HuggingFace are pretrained by users/open source outfits/companies on various types of data – NLP, Audio, Images, Videos etc. Most popular tool of choice by users is PyTorch (open source python library) which helps create a Deep Learning model from scratch or take an existing model, retrain/fine-tune (Transfer Learning) on new set of data to be published in HF. Models can be inferenced with CPUs and GPUs with slight performance improvement for smaller models.<br>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p style = 'font-size:18px;font-family:Arial;color:#00233C'><b>Why Vantage?</b></p>  \n",
    "<p style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial;color:#00233C'>As many Hugging Face models are availble in ONNX Runtime, we can load them using the BYOM feature of Vantage and run them in Vantage. Because of Graph Optimizations on ONNX Runtime, there are proven benchmarks that show that inference with ONNX Runtime will be 20% faster than a native PyTorch model on a CPU. Vantage Parallelism on top of boosted ONNX Runtime inference can turn a Vantage system as effective as inference on GPUs. If we have a Vantage box with 72 AMPs, assuming the table is perfectly distributed, it will closely match the performance of a dedicated GPU and data never moves across the network saving time and I/O operations. As parallelism increases with number of AMPs, the model inference will complete faster in Teradata Vantage with the same amount of text data vs a GPU. We can of course quantize the model (change float8 weights to int8/int4) for inference on CPU to go even faster with some tradeoff with accuracy. However, If Model size goes up GPU advantage will widen – example LLM like LLama2 and costs will be disproportionate with GPU but for smaller models we can get comparable performance. \n",
