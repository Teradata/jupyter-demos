    "Natural Language Processing (NLP) involves teaching computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language, just like people do. It's about enabling computers to read and understand text, so they can perform tasks that involve language, such as answering questions, understanding customer feedback, or even generating human-like responses.<br>Think of NLP as a translator between humans and computers. It allows computers to analyze and make sense of text data in a way that's meaningful for businesses. There are many uses of NLP that can be used in business for example <br><b>Customer Insights</b>: NLP helps businesses understand what their customers are saying across different channels like emails, reviews, or social media. It can analyze this text to identify trends, sentiments, and common issues, helping companies tailor their products and services to meet customer needs better.<br><b>Automated Support</b>: NLP powers chatbots and virtual assistants that can understand and respond to customer queries in real-time. These assistants can handle routine inquiries, provide product recommendations, or even troubleshoot problems, freeing up human agents for more complex tasks.<br><b>Information Extraction</b>: NLP can extract valuable information from unstructured text data, such as contracts, legal documents, or research papers. It helps businesses quickly find relevant information, identify key insights, and make informed decisions based on this data.<br><b>Personalization</b>: By analyzing customer interactions and preferences expressed in text, NLP enables businesses to personalize their marketing messages, offers, and user experiences. This personalized approach can lead to higher customer engagement and loyalty.<br><br>In essence, NLP empowers businesses to leverage the power of language to improve customer experiences, streamline operations, and drive better decision-making. \n",

    "Word embedding is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) to represent words as dense vectors. This allows words with similar meanings to have similar representations. Word embeddings capture semantic relationships between words, enabling NLP models to better understand and process human language.<br><br>Traditional methods of representing words, such as one-hot encoding or bag-of-words, represent each word as a sparse vector where most elements are zero and only one element is one (for one-hot encoding) or a count of occurrences (for bag-of-words). These representations do not capture semantic similarity between words and can result in high-dimensional and sparse feature spaces.<br> <br>Word embeddings represent words as dense vectors of fixed dimensionality (e.g., 100, 200, or 300 dimensions) where each dimension represents a different aspect of the word's meaning. These vectors are learned from large corpora of text using techniques like Word2Vec, GloVe, or FastText.The key idea behind word embeddings is that words that occur in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings. By training word embeddings on large text corpora, the model learns to map words with similar meanings to nearby points in the vector space. For example, in a well-trained word embedding model, the vectors for \"male\" and \"female\" are expected to be closer to each other than to the vector for \"apple\".\n",

It works by transforming the original high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space while retaining as much of the original variance as possible. PCA achieves this by identifying the principal components, which are the directions in feature space along which the data varies the most. These principal components are computed as the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of the standardized data, and they represent the most significant sources of variation in the data. By selecting a subset of the principal components that capture the most variance, PCA allows for a more compact representation of the data while preserving its essential structure and relationships. The transformed data can be used for visualization, feature extraction, noise reduction, and other analysis tasks, making PCA a powerful tool for data exploration and dimensionality reduction.</p>"

It is calculated by multiplying two factors: the term frequency (TF), which measures how frequently a word occurs in a document, and the inverse document frequency (IDF), which penalizes words that are common across multiple documents in the collection. TF-IDF assigns higher weights to words that are frequent in a document but rare in other documents, allowing it to capture the discriminative power of words in distinguishing documents.
