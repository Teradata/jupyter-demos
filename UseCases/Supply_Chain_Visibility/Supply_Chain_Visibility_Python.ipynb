    "Businesses have a long recognized the pivotal role of supply chain in their success. Supply chain visibility is the ability to view or track goods and materials as it moves through the supply chain. Businesses know that this creates and sustains a competitive advantage. Below are some of the critical capabilities of Supply Chain Visibility that creates a competitive advantage:\n",

    "    <li>Use accurate insights to provide better service, enhancing customer satisfaction</li>\n",
    "    <li>Understand the levels of risk of my material or goods not arriving when customers need them leading to Customer Service level failure, or arriving to early leading to storage and cost challenges</li>\n",
    "    <li>Use data to drive innovation and continuous improvement</li>\n",
    "    <li>Leverage data effectively and maximize investments in existing solutions</li>\n",
    "    <li>Streamline operations, reduce redundancies, and optimize workflows</li>\n",
    "    <li>Drive down the cost of goods sold and improve profitability</li>\n",
    "    <li>Reduce inventory carrying costs while maintaining required service levels</li>\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "<p style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial'>Despite knowing the importance and advantages of visibility, business fail to implement and answer the basic questions like <ul style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial'><li>Where is my inventory, what is in-transit and when will it arrive?</li><li>\n",
    "    What are my current lead times by vendor, item and receipt location?</li></ul>\n",
    "    <p style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial'>Modern supply chains are comprised of highly specialized functional silos.

Having a single version of truth also helps us mitigating the unforeseen events happening in the supply chain. This can be further enhanced to give the other analytics like inventory levels at the material warehouse to future demand forecasting or by integrating the real-time locations of the trucks/transport to predict delays etc. "
