Although the most frequently accessed data is the latest or most current data, that doesn’t mean that the older information is not useful or relevant. Historical data that’s been compiled over the years gives a rich perspective of the business, such as long-term trends and cyclical patterns.</p>\n",

    "<p style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial;color:#00233C'>Teradata Vantage provides unmatched concurrency and performance for the world's largest and most demanding enterprises to analyze their data. Analysis and concurrency needs for older information is generally substantially less as data ages, and over time there is much more history data that accumulates than current 'hot' data, it makes sense to store it somewhere that has different performance and price characteristics: for example, an object store such as Amazon S3 or Azure Blob storage.</p>\n",

But not any longer. Now, Teradata Vantage can be used to seamlessly join together all the historical and current information across the data warehouse AND object storage, without having to change the basic data structures and queries. This makes it possible to cost-effectively answer questions that could not be previously addressed so decision makers can better plan for the future.  When running this demo in the ClearScape Analytics Experience, the Vantage Database running on Google Cloud is accessing historical data that is stored on AWS S3. </p>\n",

Breaking data up into multiple files allows multiple files to be processed in parallel which improves performance reduces the impact of latency for cloud storage. It also allows reading a subset of the data. On the other hand, if each unit of parallelism needs to open lots of files for a full table scan, then that will reduce the performance due to the overhead of opening multiple files for each unit of parallelism. Hence file/folder structure will depend on the how we will access the data, if the queries are using all the years' worth of data, then there is no need to divide the data on monthly basis.</p>"
