    "<ul style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial'>\n",
    "    <li><b>Linearity</b>: In an ideal scenario where the data perfectly follows the theoretical distribution, the observed quantiles will align with the expected quantiles, resulting in a straight line. Deviations from a straight line suggest departures from the theoretical distribution.</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "<li><b>Slope</b>: The slope of the line provides information about the data's spread. If the line is steeper than the reference line (y = x), it indicates heavier tails or a greater spread than the theoretical distribution. Conversely, a flatter line indicates lighter tails or a smaller spread.</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "<li><b>Endpoints</b>: The behavior of the plot at the endpoints is significant. If the observed quantiles deviate from the expected quantiles at the extremes, it suggests deviations in the tails of the distribution.</li>\n",

    "<li><b>Outliers</b>: Outliers in the dataset can be identified as points that significantly deviate from the expected quantiles. These points might indicate extreme values or errors in the data.</li>\n",

    "<li>Age: In the Age column, we can see that the observed quantiles are nearly straight lines. So we can conclude that it is following the <b>normal distribution</b>.</li>\n",
    "<li>Monthly_income_in_thousand: The behaviour of the plot at the endpoints is significant, which leads one to conclude that it is <b>not following the normal distribution</b>.</li>\n",
    "<li>Last_contact_day: In the plot, the endpoints are significant, but the rest of the quantiles are slightly left-skewed, which means this column is <b>left-skewed and heavy-tailed</b>.</li>\n",
    "<li>Last_contact_duration: The observed quantiles are heavily left-skewed, which means this column is <b>left-skewed and heavy-tailed</b>.</li>\n",
    "<li>Days_from_last_contact: In the plot, one of the endpoints is significant, and the rest of the observed quantiles are heavily left-skewed, which means this column is <b>left-skewed and heavy-tailed</b>.</li>\n",
    "<li>Prev_contacts_performed: This column is left-skewed and heavy-tailed because only one of the endpoints in the plot is significant, and the remaining observed quantiles are substantially <b>left-skewed</b>.</li>\n",

This forces each decision tree within the \"forest\" to be different from one another, which ultimately improves the accuracy of the predictions.
