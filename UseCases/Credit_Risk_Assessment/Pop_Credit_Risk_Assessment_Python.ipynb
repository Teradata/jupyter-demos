    "<p style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial;color:#00233C'>Credit risk assessment is the process of evaluating the likelihood that a borrower will default on a financial obligation, such as repaying a loan or meeting other credit obligations. It involves analyzing various factors related to the borrower's financial health, credit history, and overall ability to repay debt. The primary goal of credit risk assessment is to enable lenders, such as banks, credit unions, or lending institutions, to make informed decisions about whether to extend credit to an individual or entity and under what terms.</p>\n",
    "<p style = 'font-size:18px;font-family:Arial;color:#00233C'><b>Business Value</b></p>\n",
    "<li style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial;color:#00233C'> One of the primary objectives of credit risk assessment is to minimize the risk of default on loans or credit lines. </li>\n",
    "<li style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial;color:#00233C'>Effective credit risk assessment enables financial institutions to make more informed lending decisions. By evaluating factors such as the borrower's credit history, income, debt levels, and other relevant data, institutions can tailor loan terms and interest rates to reflect the level of risk associated with each borrower.</li>\n",
    "<li style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial;color:#00233C'>By implementing robust credit risk assessment processes, institutions can ensure compliance with regulatory mandates such as Basel III, which requires banks to maintain adequate capital reserves based on the risk profiles of their lending portfolios. </li>\n",
    "<li style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial;color:#00233C'>By accurately assessing credit risk, institutions can offer competitive loan terms to creditworthy borrowers, thereby facilitating access to credit for individuals and businesses with demonstrated repayment capacity.</li>\n",
    "    </p>\n",
    "<p style = 'font-size:18px;font-family:Arial;color:#00233C'><b>Why Vantage?</b></p>\n",
    "<p style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial;color:#00233C'>Vantage's ClearScape Analytics provides a comprehensive library of in-database (inDb) functions tailored for various stages of the data science lifecycle, including data exploration, preparation, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. These functions seamlessly execute within the Vantage SQL engine, ensuring high performance and scalability while eliminating the need for data movement.<br>By leveraging the Teradata Python Package, specifically the teradataml OpenSourceML component, users gain the ability to utilize popular open-source machine learning packages like scikit-learn directly within the database environment. This means that data doesn't need to be transferred to the client for analysis, streamlining the workflow and enhancing efficiency.<br>The OpenSourceML package simplifies the integration of open-source machine learning functionalities into Vantage, offering a consistent interface for executing these algorithms. Users can leverage familiar syntax and arguments, making it easier to transition from traditional open-source environments to the Vantage platform.<br>Running these machine learning functions within Vantage enables organizations to scale their models effectively. Horizontal scaling allows for the training of segmented models based on various criteria such as region or user type. Meanwhile, vertical scaling enables the consolidation of data from millions or even billions of interactions, empowering organizations to leverage vast datasets for model training and analysis.<br>Furthermore, the models developed using these functionalities can be seamlessly deployed for operational use, enabling real-time understanding and prediction of actions. This operational deployment capability ensures that organizations can derive actionable insights and make informed decisions in a timely manner, driving value across various business domains.</p> "

Decision trees are a machine learning algorithm that organizes data into a tree-like structure, where each internal node represents a decision based on a feature, and each leaf node represents the outcome. By recursively splitting the data based on the most informative features, decision trees can efficiently partition the dataset into homogeneous subsets. They offer interpretability, as the tree structure can be easily understood, and implicit feature selection, revealing which features are most important for prediction. <br> With the addition of teradataml OpenSourceML functions we can seamlessly use the DecisionTreeClassifier available in scikit-learn python module as an inDb function.</p>\n"

It uses the proximity of data points to make predictions or classifications. Given an input data point, KNN identifies the k nearest neighbors (other data points) based on a chosen distance metric (usually Euclidean distance). The class label of the input point is determined by a majority vote among its k neighbors.<br> We will use scikit-learn's KNeighborsClassifier for this</p>\n"
