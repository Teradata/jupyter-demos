    "<p style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial'> Embedding models, like Word2Vec or GloVe, learn vector representations for words based on co-occurrence statistics. For instance, in Word2Vec, a word's vector is optimized to predict surrounding words in a context window. Each word's vector captures semantic relationships, with similar words having closer vectors. In essence, the model learns to represent words in a multi-dimensional space where similar words are close together. For example, \"king\" and \"queen\" might have similar vectors due to their contextual similarity in many sentences.</p>\n",

    "<p style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial'>Imagine we have a bunch of words, and we want to find a way to represent them in a way that captures their meaning. One way we can do this is by creating a word embedding. A word embedding is a vector of numbers that represents the meaning of a word. We choose the numbers in the vector so that words that are similar in meaning have similar vectors.</p>\n",

    "<p style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial'>We can use word embeddings to find the similarity between words. For example, we can calculate the cosine similarity between the vector for \"cheese\" and the vector for \"butter\". The cosine similarity is a measure of how similar two vectors are, and it ranges from 0 to 1. A cosine similarity of 1 means that the two vectors are perfectly aligned, and a cosine similarity of 0 means that the two vectors are completely unrelated.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial'>In our case, the cosine similarity between our vector for \"cheese\" and our vector for \"butter\" would be very high. This is because we consider the words \"cheese\" and \"butter\" to be very similar in meaning. We know they are both foods that are made from milk, and they are both often used in cooking.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial'>We can also use word embeddings to find related words. For example, we can find all of the words that are similar in meaning to \"cheese\". This would include words like \"milk\", \"cream\", \"yogurt\", and \"feta\".</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial'>We find word embeddings to be a powerful tool for natural language processing. We can utilize them for a variety of tasks, such as sentiment analysis, machine translation, and question answering.</p>\n",

    "<p style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial'>Imagine we have a bunch of points in a high-dimensional space.

    "<p style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial'>Now, imagine that we take a slice through our high-dimensional space. This slice will be a two-dimensional space, and the points in our two-dimensional space will represent our word embeddings. The distance between two points in our two-dimensional space will be a measure of the similarity between the two words.</p>\n",
