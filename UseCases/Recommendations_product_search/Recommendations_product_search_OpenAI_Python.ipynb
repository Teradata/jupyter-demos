For example, we can calculate the cosine similarity between the vector for \"cheese\" and the vector for \"butter\".

A cosine similarity of 1 means that the two vectors are perfectly aligned, and a cosine similarity of 0 means that the two vectors are completely unrelated.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial'>In this case, the cosine similarity between the vector for \"cheese\" and the vector for \"butter\" would be very high.

    "\n",
    "<p style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial'>We can also use word embeddings to find related words. For example, we can find all of the words that are similar in meaning to \"cheese\". This would include words like \"milk\", \"cream\", \"yogurt\", and \"feta\".</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial'>Word embeddings are a powerful tool for natural language processing. They can be used for a variety of tasks, such as sentiment analysis, machine translation, and question answering.</p>\n",
