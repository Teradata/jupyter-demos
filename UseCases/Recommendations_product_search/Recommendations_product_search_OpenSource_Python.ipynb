In essence, the model learns to represent words in a multi-dimensional space where similar words are close together. For example, \"king\" and \"queen\" might have similar vectors due to their contextual similarity in many sentences.</p>\n",

A cosine similarity of 1 means that the two vectors are perfectly aligned, and a cosine similarity of 0 means that the two vectors are completely unrelated.</p>\n",

    "<p style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial;color:#00233C'>In our case, the cosine similarity between our vector for \"cheese\" and our vector for \"butter\" would be very high.
