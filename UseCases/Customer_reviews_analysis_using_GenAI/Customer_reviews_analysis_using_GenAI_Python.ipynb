    "<p style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial'>Customer reviews analysis is a crucial aspect of understanding customer sentiment and preferences.

    "<p style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial'>In our demo,  we use the <code>TDApiClient</code> Vantage function to generate reviews embeddings in parallel. This approach can significantly enhance the performance of generating the embeddings at scale.</p>\n",

    "<p style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial'>In this demo, we will build a customer review analysis system using <b>TDApiClient InDB Analytic Function</b>. Customer reviews analysis involves processing and analyzing customer feedback to identify patterns, sentiment, and trends. This analysis can help businesses improve their products, services, and overall customer experience. By integrating <b>OpenAIEmbeddings</b> and <b>Vantage InDB Analytic Function</b>, we can perform advanced natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to extract meaningful insights from customer reviews. </p>\n",

    "\n",
    "<p style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial'> &emsp;  &emsp; We believe that embeddings are the AI-native way to represent any kind of data, making them the perfect fit for us when working with all kinds of AI-powered tools and algorithms. We can represent text, images, and soon audio and video. We have many options for creating embeddings, whether locally using an installed library or by calling an API.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial'> Embedding models, like Word2Vec or GloVe, learn vector representations for words based on co-occurrence statistics. For instance, in Word2Vec, a word's vector is optimized to predict surrounding words in a context window. Each word's vector captures semantic relationships, with similar words having closer vectors. In essence, the model learns to represent words in a multi-dimensional space where similar words are close together. For example, \"king\" and \"queen\" might have similar vectors due to their contextual similarity in many sentences.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial'>Imagine we have a bunch of words, and we want to find a way to represent them in a way that captures their meaning. One way we can do this is by creating a word embedding. A word embedding is a vector of numbers that represents the meaning of a word. We choose the numbers in the vector so that words that are similar in meaning have similar vectors.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial'>For example, we might have vectors for words like \"cheese,\" \"butter,\" \"chocolate,\" and \"sauce\" that look like the following:</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"images/word_embeddings.png\" alt=\"word_embeddings\"  width=1000 height=800/></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<p style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial'>In our vector, the numbers don't have any special meaning by themselves. They just represent the way that the word \"cheese\" is related to other words in our vocabulary.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial'>We can use word embeddings to find the similarity between words. For example, we can calculate the cosine similarity between the vector for \"cheese\" and the vector for \"butter\". The cosine similarity is a measure of how similar two vectors are, and it ranges from 0 to 1. A cosine similarity of 1 means that the two vectors are perfectly aligned, and a cosine similarity of 0 means that the two vectors are completely unrelated.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial'>We can also use word embeddings to find related words. For example, we can find all of the words that are similar in meaning to \"cheese\". This would include words like \"milk\", \"cream\", \"yogurt\", and \"feta\".</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial'>We find word embeddings to be a powerful tool for natural language processing. We can utilize them for a variety of tasks, such as sentiment analysis, machine translation, and question answering.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial'>Above is a visual representation of how word embeddings work.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial'>Imagine we have a bunch of points in a high-dimensional space. Each point represents a word, and our position in space represents the meaning of the word. Words that are similar in meaning will be close together in space, and words that are different in meaning will be far apart.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial'>Now, imagine that we take a slice through our high-dimensional space. This slice will be a two-dimensional space, and the points in our two-dimensional space will represent our word embeddings. The distance between two points in our two-dimensional space will be a measure of the similarity between the two words.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial'>In this way, we can use word embeddings to represent the meaning of words in a way that is both compact and informative.</p>"
