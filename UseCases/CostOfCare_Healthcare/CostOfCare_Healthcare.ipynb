    "<p style='font-size:16px;font-family:Arial;color:#00233C'> With rising healthcare expenditures, there's a growing urgency to track, analyze, and optimize cost drivers across emergency room (ER), imaging, surgical, and mental health services. Traditional cost auditing methods are retrospective, siloed, and lack the granularity to enable proactive cost containment. By leveraging advanced analytics and integrated hospital datasets, a scalable, dynamic, and contextual cost intelligence solution can be achieved. However, key challenges remain: </p> <ul style='font-size:16px;font-family:Arial;color:#00233C'> <li>Fragmented cost data across procedures, diagnoses, and provider systems.</li> <li>Lack of context linking ER visits, imaging, surgeries, and mental health costs to patient pathways.</li> <li>Limited visual insights into cost trends across time, region, and condition severity.</li> <li>Need for scalable, in-database analytics to handle massive healthcare datasets.</li> </ul> <p style='font-size:16px;font-family:Arial;color:#00233C'> <b>Proposed Solution:</b><br> AI-Driven Healthcare Cost Intelligence using Teradata Vantage<br> Ingest structured data from ER visits, imaging studies, surgical procedures, and mental health conditions. Aggregate and normalize cost trends by diagnosis, time, and geography using in-database processing in Teradata Vantage. Empower analysts with interactive dashboards (X-ray/Echo trackers, Top Cost Drivers, Health Rankings) built on ipywidgets and Matplotlib for granular exploration. Integrate hospital performance scores and county-level health rankings to support value-based decision making. </p> <p style='font-size:16px;font-family:Arial;color:#00233C'> <b>Benefits:</b> <ul style='font-size:16px;font-family:Arial;color:#00233C'> <li>End-to-end cost visibility across all major healthcare services—ER, imaging, surgery, and mental health.</li> <li>Identification of high-cost hospitals and procedures with spatial and temporal granularity.</li> <li>Scalable feature engineering and analytics via Teradata’s in-database capabilities.</li> <li>Supports hospital value-based purchasing (HBVP) and patient-centric care strategies.</li> <li>Interactive and user-friendly dashboards enable deep dives into cost outliers and overutilization patterns.</li> </ul> </p>"
