    "<p style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial;color:#00233C'>Successful AI/ML implementations face three main challenges:</p>\n",
    "<li style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial;color:#00233C'><b>The Data Problem:</b> Quality data and feature engineering consume 80% of the implementation time. Even when different use cases share the same source data and features, organizations often handle data preparation separately.</li>\n",
    "<li style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial;color:#00233C'><b>The Scale Problem:</b> Real-world use cases often require multiple models. In production, these models require fresh features engineered in the same way as during training. Ensuring the auditability of these features behind model decisions is crucial.</li>\n",
    "<li style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial;color:#00233C'><b>The Deployment Problem:</b> Transitioning prototypes to production, especially operationalizing data prep pipelines, is often problematic.</li></p>\n",

Although most Features are considered as re-usable, there is still some minor part of Features that must be calculated as model-specific (e.g., scaled variables, principal components, etc.) and then combined with the rest of the pre-calculated Features into a single data set (ADS).

If the same data definitions are used to affect the outcome, as is used to gain the initial insights, then there is more likely to be aligned to the strategy, and the outcome will have a positive impact on the business.</p>"
