This consists of the 8 tables that make up the TPCH Benchmark.  Since this tiny platform is for functional testing, the scale of this data is 1 GB. This is provided as a coordinated set of tables to use with your BI tools. (The TPC-H queries are not representative of the typical mixed workload we observe on production platforms since 82% scan over 24 months of data.  The data lacks realistic skew. For example, there are exactly 4 line items for every order).

-  CUSTOMER - 150,0009 rows
