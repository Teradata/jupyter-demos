    "<p style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial;color:#00233C'>According to the CDC, the number of emergency room visits in 2017 for issues related to the heart and blood vessels was nearly 5 million. Plus, heart attacks are one of the most expensive conditions treated in U.S. hospitals - cardiac care costs an estimated $11.5 billion a year. Being able to identify these conditions in people before a heart attack can not only help patients save money, but also save their lives. With Teradata Vantage and ClearScape Analytics, users can better understand the full picture of their patient’s health. Doctors and physicians can have a better understanding of their health and predict whether heart failure is expected.</p>\n",
    "<p style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial;color:#00233C'>It's estimated that by 2035, more than 45 percent of Americans are projected to have some form of cardiovascular disease, meaning that heart failure prediction is an issue that will need to be better predicated. With Teradata’s capabilities, machine learning can be useful in heart failure prediction as it can analyze large amounts of data from multiple sources and identify complex patterns that may be difficult for humans to recognize. This can potentially improve the accuracy of prediction models and help healthcare professionals identify patients who are at high risk for heart failure, allowing for earlier intervention and better outcomes.</p>\n",
