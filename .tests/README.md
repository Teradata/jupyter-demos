# ClearScape Analyticsâ„¢ Playwright Testing

This guide assists notebook developers in providing testing inputs for the prompts in the Jupyter notebook. For notebooks that require more inputs than the DBPassword, users can provide a file to facilitate the Playwright CI process. This file should have the same filename as the notebook and end with the extension `.yaml` and also the filename should start with `.` to make it hidden file. It should reside in the same directory as the notebook. If the notebook does not require this file, there's no need to create one.

The configuration file is a simple set of key-value pairs in yaml format

```

  - type: env
