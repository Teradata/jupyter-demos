    "<p style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial;color:#00233C'>Retail stores rely on sales and an accurate amount of inventory to support these sales. However, demand can be everchanging leading to stores being overstocked or out of stock. In these situations, retail stores need to quickly adjust to increase revenues and avoid additional unnecessary costs. The best way to keep ROI up is with retail demand forecasting in Teradata Vantage and ClearScape Analytics. Teradata’s capabilities allow users to combine and analyze sales and inventory data across all stores, while taking into consideration seasonal events, such as holidays or the weather. Bringing together all the components that influence customers to buy products allows retail stores to accurately predict sales and demand to ensure for precise inventory.</p>\n",

    "<p style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial;color:#00233C'>We have trained and validated the ARIMA model on the Weekly Sales dataset, and the results closely match the actual data. The goodness of fit metrics calculated in the estimate and validate phase also resonate with our understanding that the model is well-trained to forecast. This can be observed in the Estimate and the Validate function graphs. So, we can say that the model is well trained to forecast the Weekly Sales.</p>\n",

    "<p style = 'font-size:16px;font-family:Arial;color:#00233C'>Thus with Teradata Vantage we can do rapid data exploration, preparation, and testing functions that can analyze massive amounts of data across an unlimited number of forecasts in parallel, drastically reducing the development and testing times. We can create unlimited number of forecasts in parallel, unlocking value in hyper-segmented (per-store-per-SKU inventory demand, per-household energy consumption) predictions, based on individualized models. </p>"
